moddir_autoindex
================
This modul is a replacement for the Apache-Server-Module mod_autoindex.
Implementation is just as cgi-script without any defined server-extension,
but requires "mod_dir" which usually is enabled anyway.
"mod_autoindex" can be deactivated but is not triggered anymore with this script.


Please consult the [wiki](https://github.com/DavidBruchmann/moddir_autoindex/wiki) for further description and installation.
